// Package stepentry carries the durable "step-entry" allocation contract from

// transaction that persists the step change. It intentionally has no
// dependency on the task repository package; the repository reads only the
// already-resolved PendingAllocation/AllocationResult shapes carried on
// context, mirroring how internal/steptelemetry threads attribution.
//
// Only clear_decisions and queue_run_for_each_participant are marker-bearing
// (carry a step-entry marker and an allocated position). queue_run and
// run_code_review are ledger-owned but not marker-bearing — see
// ownershipTable's doc comment for the full eleven-kind classification.
