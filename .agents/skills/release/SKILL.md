# Release & Versioning

Kandev Stable releases use a **single SemVer** `X.Y.Z` shared across all distribution channels.
npm also has an explicit prerelease-only `nightly` channel; it is not part of the unified Stable
artifact set.

## Version targets

- `apps/cli/package.json` version → `X.Y.Z`
- npm main package: `kandev@X.Y.Z`
- npm runtime packages: `@kdlbs/runtime-{platform}@X.Y.Z` (5 platforms; declared as `optionalDependencies` in main package)
- Git tag: `vX.Y.Z` (three-part; legacy `vM.m` tags normalize to `M.m.0`)
- Homebrew formula: `kdlbs/homebrew-kandev` `Formula/kandev.rb` `version "X.Y.Z"`
- Scoop bucket: `kdlbs/scoop-kandev` `bucket/kandev.json` version, URL, and hash
- GitHub release: `vX.Y.Z` with standard platform archives `kandev-{platform}.tar.gz`, full offline archives `kandev-{platform}-full.tar.gz`, checksums, Windows ZIP equivalents, remote helper assets, and `runtime-size-report.md`

Stable default archive names contain the standard runtime: host `kandev`, host `agentctl`, and
`remote-helpers.json`. The `-full` archives also contain all four remote helper executables. Stable
npm packages, Homebrew, Scoop, winget, Chocolatey, and Desktop use standard archives. Containers
and npm Nightlies stay full. Desktop keeps one standard installer and updater track.

**npm, Homebrew, and Scoop are sibling channels**, not chained. All three consume the same GitHub release artifacts; none depends on another package-manager channel.

For npm Nightly, Stable `X.Y.Z` plus a full `main` SHA produces
`X.Y.(Z+1)-nightly.sha<first-12-lowercase-hex>`. `kandev` and all five runtime packages publish at
that exact version under npm's `nightly` dist-tag. Nightly never moves `latest` and creates no Git
tag, GitHub Release, Homebrew formula, Scoop bucket update, Desktop feed/build, or container tag.

## Release flow

Stable runs entirely in CI via `.github/workflows/release.yml`, triggered by a maintainer from the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Maintainer clicks "Run workflow" → keeps `channel=stable` → picks `bump` (patch/minor/major) → optional `dry_run` or `desktop_validation_only`.
2. `prepare` job bumps version + regenerates CHANGELOG, opens release PR, squash-merges, tags `vX.Y.Z`.
3. `build-web`, `build-bundles`, `build-remote-helpers`, `build-desktop`, and both Docker builds create the channel inputs.
4. `publish-release` promotes staged standard archives to the existing default names, publishes full archives and helper assets, then attaches checksums, the size report, desktop artifacts, and notes.
5. `publish-npm` publishes 5 `@kdlbs/runtime-*` packages + main `kandev` package to npmjs.
6. `update-homebrew-tap` pushes updated `Formula/kandev.rb` to `kdlbs/homebrew-kandev` via SSH deploy key.
7. `update-scoop-bucket` pushes updated `bucket/kandev.json` to `kdlbs/scoop-kandev` via its SSH deploy key.

## Release PR ruleset bypass

A normal Stable release creates its branch and pull request with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
It uses `RELEASE_PR_BYPASS_TOKEN` only for an exact-head `gh pr merge --admin`.

Store this fine-grained personal access token in the protected `release`
environment. Its owner must remain an organization administrator. Select only
`kdlbs/kandev` and grant `contents: write` repository permission.

Record the token owner and expiration date. Rotate the environment secret before
the token expires or the owner loses administrator access. The workflow must
stop before tag creation when the token is missing or cannot bypass the ruleset.

After the merge, use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to read the PR state. Tag only the merge
commit that GitHub reports after it appears on `origin/main`.

**Workflow-control invariant:** When a channel intentionally skips a job, every
downstream job reachable through that dependency chain must use a status function
such as `!cancelled()` plus explicit `needs.<job>.result == 'success'` checks.
For a partial Stable release, preserve the existing signed tag and rerun with
`backfill_tag`; never run a normal bump against an existing tag. Declare Stable
complete only after `publish-release`, `publish-npm`, `update-homebrew-tap`, and
`update-scoop-bucket` each succeed and their artifacts are verified—an aggregate
green run can hide skipped publication jobs.

Required web, runtime, and desktop artifact uploads attempt up to three times,
with waits of 30 seconds and 60 seconds between attempts. They fail explicitly
when an expected file is missing. Desktop matrix targets use `fail-fast: false`
so a transient upload failure does not cancel sibling targets, but publication
still requires the complete matrix to succeed. Rerun a failed producer job in
the same workflow run after a transient failure. If the signed tag already
exists and the run remains partial, use `backfill_tag` for that tag after
checking which channels already succeeded.

Stable has no local release driver; the entire Stable flow runs in GHA. The Nightly metadata and
publication revalidation state machine lives in `scripts/release/nightly-release.sh`, which GHA
invokes for scheduled and manual Nightly runs.

The same workflow schedules npm Nightly with cron `0 12 * * *`. It skips before building when
`main` has no commit after the latest Stable tag, the exact commit is already published, or a same
or newer `main` Nightly supersedes the scheduled commit. Eligible runs build only the shared web
bundle and five native runtime archives, then publish runtimes first and `kandev` last with OIDC
provenance. Stable and Nightly workflow runs share one non-cancelling release-wide concurrency
slot. Before publishing, Nightly rechecks the stable Git/npm baseline and the previously observed
`nightly` tag; a pending Stable tag or moved value safely suppresses stale publication.

Maintainers may run that same Nightly path from the Actions UI with the `main` ref and
`channel=nightly`. `dry_run=true` retains the real metadata and registry preflight but skips shared
builds and all npm writes. The shared form's required `bump` value is ignored for Nightly;
`desktop_validation_only` and `backfill_tag` are Stable-only and rejected when combined with it.

Validate Nightly automation changes with:

```bash
node --test scripts/release/nightly-version.test.mjs scripts/release/nightly-release.test.mjs
python3 .github/scripts/release-workflow-contract_test.py
bash -n scripts/release/nightly-release.sh scripts/release/publish-npm.sh
```

## Release-tag signing configuration

The release workflow reads signing configuration from the GitHub `release`
environment. `RELEASE_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` and the optional
`RELEASE_GPG_PASSPHRASE` are environment secrets. The full 40-character
`RELEASE_GPG_FINGERPRINT` is an environment variable, not a secret: the
workflow reads `vars.RELEASE_GPG_FINGERPRINT`, so storing it as a secret makes
normal-release preflight treat it as missing.

`.github/release-signing-key.asc` must contain exactly one public primary key
whose fingerprint matches that variable; never commit private key material.
`backfill_tag` repairs publication for an already-signed existing tag only and
does not bypass the normal-release signing checks.

Desktop signing is automatic. Complete macOS/Windows signing and notarization secrets produce signed artifacts; missing or incomplete signing inputs produce unsigned desktop artifacts and the GitHub release notes get an unsigned-artifact warning. `desktop_validation_only=true` builds artifacts from the current workflow ref for maintainer inspection and skips the release PR, tag, GitHub release, npm publish, Homebrew update, Scoop update, and public container tags.

## Runtime resolution

The published npm shim (`apps/cli/bin/native-shim.js`) locates its bundled runtime via:

1. `KANDEV_BUNDLE_DIR` env var (set by Homebrew wrapper, used by tests).
2. Installed `@kdlbs/runtime-{platform}` npm package via `require.resolve()`.
3. The Homebrew/manual install path execs `bin/kandev` directly. (`--runtime-version` is rejected by the native launcher.)

## Runtime helper binary checklist

When adding, renaming, or removing bundled helper binaries such as `agentctl-<goos>-<goarch>`, update every packaging surface in the same PR:

- backend build targets and scripts
- Docker/runtime image copy steps
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` bundle, macOS signing, and notarization loops
- `scripts/release/prepare-desktop-runtime.sh`
- `scripts/release/verify-desktop-runtime.sh`
- `scripts/release/remote-helper-assets.mjs`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/remote_helper_manifest.go` and the cache resolver
- `scripts/release-desktop.test.sh`
- `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md` runtime resource list

Verify with the helper build plus release-runtime tests, for example:

```bash
make -C apps/backend build-agentctl-remote
bash scripts/release-desktop.test.sh
```
