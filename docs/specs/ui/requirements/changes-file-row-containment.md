# Changes File Row Containment Requirements

## Overview

The Changes panel can be narrower than the browser viewport, and repository file
paths can be arbitrarily long. File identity must adapt to the panel's available
inline width without covering the change statistics and status cue that explain
the row. The UI system owns this presentation contract; repository paths, pull
request data, Git status, and diff routing remain owned by their existing
systems.

## Requirements

### REQ-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-001: Preserve file identity and trailing metadata

**Intent:** Keep every Changes file row understandable and actionable when its
path is longer than the available panel width.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-001.1:** When a working-tree or pull-request file row has a path wider than the available Changes panel, the directory and filename shall truncate within the row without overlapping its addition count, deletion count, or status marker.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-001.2:** The trailing addition count, deletion count, and status marker shall remain fully contained and readable at every supported Changes panel width.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-001.3:** Truncation shall preserve the row's existing full-path title and its click or tap outcome, including the pull-request and repository identity used to open the diff.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-001.4:** Desktop and phone Changes surfaces shall provide the same containment behavior without adding horizontal overflow to the panel or document.

### REQ-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002: Compact touch file rows

**Intent:** Let phone users scan file names without inline actions consuming most of each row.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002.1:** On phones and coarse-pointer devices, working-tree rows shall prioritize the basename, place directory context below it in list mode, and allow long basenames to wrap. Deep tree indentation shall not consume the filename or metadata width. A normal one-line basename and directory shall fit in a row no taller than 56px at the standard root font.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002.2:** Each touch row shall offer one visible action-menu trigger with a small icon and a hit target of at least 44px in both dimensions. Stage or Unstage, Edit, and Discard shall remain reachable through that menu; tapping the file identity shall still open its diff or image.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002.3:** The menu shall expose the full path, retain repository and staged-layer identity, disable staging while pending, and preserve discard confirmation and cancellation. Closing it without an action shall return focus to its trigger.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002.4:** Fine-pointer desktop rows shall retain their inline staging, hover actions, tree indentation, and compact sizing. Responsive presentation shall not change saved file-list preferences.
- **AC-UI-CHANGES-FILE-ROW-CONTAINMENT-002.5:** After a touch pointer activates the file-row action trigger, the menu shall remain visible through its opening animation until the user selects an action or dismisses it.

## Out of scope

- Changing file-path, diff-statistic, or file-status data.
- Changing row ordering, grouping, Git action semantics, or diff-source precedence.
- Changing the Changes panel's resize limits, scroll ownership, or mobile entry point.
