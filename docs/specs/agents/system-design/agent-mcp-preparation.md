# Agent MCP preparation system design

## Ownership and mapping

Agents owns selection and adapter preparation; executors supply trusted local
workspace/environment context, and tasks expose existing preparation progress.
This extends the [Cursor import](cursor-plugin-mcp-import.md) and
[credential bridge](cursor-mcp-oauth-bridge.md). Their filesystem discovery,
policy and ownership guarantees remain; this design supersedes their exclusion
of automatic approval only for final eligible profile-authorized imports.

| Requirement | Design sections |
| --- | --- |
| REQ-AGENTS-MCP-PREP-001 | Profile and discovery contract; settings UI |
| REQ-AGENTS-MCP-PREP-002 | Adapter; lifecycle and progress; concurrency |
| REQ-AGENTS-MCP-PREP-003 | Recovery; credential continuity |

See [the approval boundary decision](../../../decisions/2026-09-28-profile-authorized-mcp-preparation.md).

## Profile and discovery contract

Add `MCPSelectionMode string` / wire `mcp_selection_mode` with values `inherit`
and `selected`, plus `MCPSelectedServers []string` / `mcp_selected_servers`.
SQLite stores TEXT defaults `'inherit'` and `'[]'`; fresh and replay migrations,
table rebuild copies, DTOs, duplicates, catalog generation, frontend boot/action
normalization and runtime resolver all preserve them. Omitted create defaults
to inherit; omitted patch preserves; explicit empty selected list is meaningful.
Reject invalid modes, non-string/empty/duplicate identifiers or excessive lists
at the settings boundary. IDs are exact native emitted server names, scoped by
the profile's agent adapter. Preserve unknown selected IDs as unavailable rows
so discovery outages/removal cannot silently edit the saved profile.

Keep the existing `cursor_plugins_mcp_enabled` and `cursor_mcp_auth_enabled`
switches as compatibility gates. Selection only filters automatic imports.
It cannot override native disable state, policy, reserved names, or user-owned
project/profile entries. New adapters require explicit capabilities; do not
infer support from an executable name or expose Cursor stores to other agents.

Add `GET /api/v1/agents/:id/mcp-discovery` in agent settings handlers. `:id` is
the persisted agent ID; resolve its registered type/strategy on the backend.
The read operation returns `{agent_id,provider_id,status,reason?,servers}` where status
is `ready|unavailable|unsupported` and each server contains only
`{id,name,plugin_name?,source_kind,credentials_available}`. No URLs, commands,
headers, env, auth values, account identities or raw provider errors are returned.
Reuse existing native inventory and manifest parsing with bounded requests.
Credential availability scans existing eligible objects without writing a
master or approving anything. Missing credentials mean unavailable, not an
OAuth failure. Discovery is a host preview; task-specific source disables and
runtime locality are authoritative at launch. Refresh never changes selection.

## Agent adapter and native execution

Use a small agent-neutral contract in the existing `mcpconfig` boundary for
sanitized discovery results, preparation stage/failure codes and native command
execution. The first implementation is Cursor. Do not create a generic plugin
framework or enable another adapter implicitly.

The Cursor adapter invokes the installed CLI directly with argv, never a shell:
`cursor-agent mcp enable <exact-id>` for each final Kandev-owned import, then
`cursor-agent mcp list-tools <exact-id>` to prove readiness. Use the same local
runtime HOME and workspace as the conversational process. Resolve the approved
agent binary using existing runtime executable resolution where applicable.
No model prompt, account login, blanket approval flag or business tool call is
part of automatic preparation. Command output is bounded, classified and
otherwise discarded; raw output never reaches generic logs/session metadata.
Use context deadlines and process cleanup, an injected runner for tests and
allowlisted reason codes. Bound the complete preparation, not only each command.

Readiness states distinguish ready, authentication_required, approval_failed,
connection_failed and unavailable. Unknown/nonzero output is connection_failed,
never inferred to be OAuth from mere tool absence. Versioned fixtures cover
native status strings; unsupported output fails visibly rather than succeeding.

The enable operation can clear native disables. Re-read selected source/task
disables and confirm the exact final owned fingerprint immediately before it;
never invoke it on vetoed, user-edited or stale candidates. Capture the final
configuration after policy URL rewriting, not the original manifest.

## Lifecycle and progress

Reuse `PrepareStep`, `PrepareProgressEventPayload`, `newProgressCallback`,
`prepareProgressRecorder`, `SerializePrepareResult` and the existing
`executor.prepare.progress/completed` pipeline. Introduce stable kinds
`agent_mcp_discovery`, `agent_mcp_selection`, `agent_mcp_credentials`,
`agent_mcp_approval` and `agent_mcp_verification`. Per-server rows carry bounded
`mcp_server_id` and `mcp_provider`; `failure_code` is a closed domain code.
UI translates kind/status/failure, not arbitrary backend text.

Integrate shared preparation before ACP/terminal process start, including fresh,
resume and workspace promotion. `launchInternal` currently publishes completed
before MCP materialization; move or aggregate completion so executor steps are
preserved and the final result includes MCP preparation. Preserve persisted
prepare_result on session reload and do not replace it with MCP-only steps on
resume. Progress and completion carry a preparation identity plus an ordered start
marker. Current-attempt progress supersedes prior-attempt state; delayed older
progress/completion cannot replace a successor even if the client never saw
that older attempt. Persist the markers with prepare_result for reload.

An auth/connection failure for an optional imported MCP is a visible degraded
preparation outcome: retain the task environment and other usable tools, with
failed per-server rows and recovery actions. Do not fabricate a ready state or
abort access to the terminal required for recovery. Configuration integrity,
stale-ownership and unsafe-path failures remain launch-blocking. The UI must
not label a degraded result as all steps successful.

## Concurrency and isolation

Retain the Cursor canonical-workspace generation fence and containment checks.
External I/O stays outside the global project-write mutex. Serialize native
approval per canonical workspace with cancellation/current-generation checks
and fingerprint revalidation; stale work cannot approve a newer definition.
Avoid leaking lock-map entries. Source repository remains primary RepoSpecs or
trusted persisted metadata, never ordinary attached folders or credential origin.
Gate before host discovery or native commands for unsupported strategies,
remote/container/unknown executors, different HOME and import-disabled profiles.
Credential sharing and import enablement remain independently testable.

## Authentication recovery

Expose `POST /api/v1/task-sessions/:sessionId/mcp/authenticate` with JSON
`{server_id}` and response `{terminal_id, task_environment_id, label, reused}`.
Expose `POST /api/v1/task-sessions/:sessionId/mcp/retry` with the same body and
response `{provider_id, server_id, status, reason_code?, tool_count?}`. Status
uses the readiness states above. Server IDs remain JSON values, not URL paths.
These typed actions carry only session ID and native server ID. Resolve the live task execution, selected execution
profile, provider, current owned definition and local eligibility on the backend.
Reject stale/unselected/disabled/unsafe identity and terminal task states.
Build a server-specific native login command from trusted executable/argv and
open it through the existing task user-shell/terminal service; do not accept
an arbitrary client command. Preserve shell environment and cwd parity with
the task, and safely quote only at the existing user-shell command boundary.
The dedicated terminal shows the native browser consent URL and callback flow.
Raw auth URLs/output are confined to the explicit terminal, not preparation
logs or chat. Reuse/focus an existing in-flight login terminal for the same
session/server rather than starting duplicate consent flows. A login attempt is
one-shot: terminal WebSocket reconnection must never execute a completed login
again. Track the attempt explicitly on the backend; browser socket lifetime is
not process lifetime. A later explicit Authenticate action starts a new attempt
after failure or completion, while concurrent/in-flight requests reuse one.

A task-local Authenticate action opens that terminal on desktop and phone.
After consent, a visible Retry connection action rechecks readiness through
Kandev. The backend owns safe same-session reconnect/catalog reload before
returning ready. Cursor requires replacing the ACP child before loading the
exact saved ACP ID: same-process session/load acknowledges success while
retaining a failed MCP client cache. Initialize the replacement and reconnect
its streams, without session/new or prompt replay; the UI must not launch/resume again. Do not create a new
task/session or replay completed prompts. Use existing
session restart/terminal UI plumbing rather than injecting a model message.
Recovery is user initiated; profile selection alone never opens an OAuth browser.
The initial native login-terminal adapter supports POSIX host shells. Native
Windows login-terminal recovery returns unavailable until a shell-aware Windows
command adapter is verified; it must never send POSIX quoting to PowerShell.
Same-conversation automatic reload is initially supported for ACP sessions with
an owned persisted ACP ID. Cursor terminal sessions do not currently persist an
owned native CLI chat ID, so live TUI retry returns unavailable. Never resume
an arbitrary latest chat or treat a Kandev/ACP ID as a terminal chat ID. Native
initial preparation and the task-local login terminal remain supported for TUI.

## Credential continuity

Retain whole-object source selection and exclusions. Track private provenance
for the bridge's generated master: selected eligible source identity/fingerprint
and last-projected object fingerprint, never token values in provenance. If the
same eligible source object remains unchanged but Cursor has updated the master,
preserve that native-updated whole object during rebuild. A removed source drops
the entry, including removal of the last eligible source: an existing owned
task link must not keep exposing stale credentials from the old master. Clear
the generated snapshot safely or detach the owned link before launch. A changed
source re-enters normal selection. A corrupt/missing
provenance record does not make the old master an authoritative source.
Use restrictive permissions, containment/regular-file checks, atomic writes and
existing auth locking. Recheck the observed master fingerprint before publication
and abort without replacing an observed concurrent native write. Cursor does not
share Kandev's lock; this is not cross-process atomic compare-and-swap, and an
external update after the final check cannot be serialized by this process. Test refresh preservation, changed/removed sources,
partial failures and invalid provenance. Do not merge token/client objects or
implement provider refresh in Kandev. If native login replaces the task symlink
with a regular file, preserve it under the existing bridge contract and report
its current state; do not overwrite it to force sharing.

## Settings and task UI

Extend `CursorProfilePreferences` through the shared profile draft/save pipeline,
using generic selection fields. Desktop presents grouped rows; phone stacks the
server name, plugin/source and credential-availability text in selectable rows
with 44px hit targets. Keep one page scroll owner and existing save/discard.
In inherit mode show preview, in selected mode allow checkbox selection. Retain
saved unavailable IDs. Localize all copy in the six real locales and generate
Traditional Chinese/pseudo through existing scripts.

Extend the existing task preparation surface rather than chat. Typed per-server
rows show failures and Authenticate/Retry actions; expanded details contain
sanitized status only. Use the existing mobile terminal navigation, not a new
nested drawer or desktop-only tab. Guard async discovery by profile/agent and
request generation so stale responses never reset current choices.

## Verification

Unit/integration tests inject credential/native-command boundaries. Browser E2E
runs in isolated managed fixtures with sanitized discovery/status responses,
real profile persistence and preparation event/reload behavior. Real Cursor
smoke uses an isolated HOME/workspace, existing Cursor account only in memory,
a local authenticated fixture and no personal provider credentials. The test
must invoke Kandev preparation and then call the fixture without an out-of-band
manual enable/login. Test both ACP and terminal and preserve tool permissions.
