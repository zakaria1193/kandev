# Task 02: Share Session Read Ownership

## Summary

Make concurrent shell, commit, and cumulative-diff consumers share outstanding
reads and initialization state. Preserve legitimate refresh and context changes.

## In scope

- Store-scoped coordination with typed resource keys, promise ownership, dirty
  generations, one retry owner, and bounded inactive bookkeeping.
- Migration of the three hooks and all cumulative-diff invalidation callers.
- Existing domain result stores, readiness/terminal behavior, and shared loading
  state; retain last-known diff behavior inside the correct store scope.

## Out of scope

New backend APIs, message history polling, UI layout/copy, dependency additions,
and a general query-cache migration.

## Acceptance

1. Two or more same-scope consumers issue one initial read and observe shared
   loading/result state. Later mounting alone does not refetch; failed reads
   remain retryable and settled inactive bookkeeping is bounded (`.2`).
2. Invalidation bursts during a read produce one necessary follow-up. Unmounting
   one consumer or settling an obsolete promise cannot release another owner's
   guard; terminal/readiness and authoritative-empty semantics remain correct.
3. Different stores, auth identities, workspace generations, connection epochs,
   sessions, or shell request arguments cannot share or publish stale data.
   Include a same-store transition and reversed response order (`.5`).

## Implementation sequence

1. Mark in progress. Mount multiple real-store consumers with deferred transport
   responses. First prove current shell/commit duplication and diff guard reset
   failures through the actual hooks.
2. Implement the narrowly scoped coordinator following preview-feedback's
   `WeakMap<AppStore, ...>` pattern, with identity-checked finalization. Domain
   adapters retain request argument and result handling details.
3. Move successful initialization out of per-hook refs and remove subscriber
   resets of shared in-flight state. Preserve explicit refresh generations.
4. Scope cumulative-diff cache/listeners/timers and change invalidation callers
   to pass their store. Update affected test mocks in the same pass.
5. Cover environment-only to task-scoped shell hydration, session changes in one
   environment, reconnect on the same client, last-consumer departure, timeout,
   mid-flight invalidation, late old completion, and authoritative empty commits.
6. Run targeted checks and record RED/GREEN results. Task 04 counts browser reads.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run lib/state/session-read-coordinator.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-user-shells.test.tsx hooks/domains/session/use-session-commits.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-cumulative-diff.test.ts lib/state/slices/session-runtime/user-shells.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec eslint lib/state/session-read-coordinator.ts lib/state/session-read-coordinator.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-user-shells.ts hooks/domains/session/use-user-shells.test.tsx hooks/domains/session/use-session-commits.ts hooks/domains/session/use-session-commits.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-cumulative-diff.ts hooks/domains/session/use-cumulative-diff.test.ts lib/ws/handlers/git-status.ts components/task/base-branch-picker.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
git diff --check
```

Also run an existing caller's focused test if changing its invalidation wiring
changes behavior; record the exact path and result. Do not drop an existing
assertion merely to accommodate the new coordinator signature.

## Dependencies

Task 01 precedes this work in the sequential delivery order. Its code is not a
technical dependency of the coordinator.

## Risks

Do not let an environment-only shell response overwrite a later task-scoped
result. Do not suppress legitimate commit snapshots merely because events
populated the store. Keep a dirty key dirty while it has no subscribers, without
running a detached refresh loop. Inactive eviction must not evict an active
promise into duplicate requests.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements `.2`, `.5`](../../specs/ui/requirements/task-navigation-responsiveness.md)
- [Shared session reads](../../specs/ui/system-design/task-navigation-responsiveness.md#shared-session-reads)
- `hooks/domains/comments/use-preview-feedback.ts`
- `lib/state/workspace-context.ts` and `lib/ws/connection.ts`
- Existing commit/diff hook tests for terminal and invalidation contracts

## Results

- RED: all three real-store multi-consumer tests made two reads instead of one;
  older shell responses also overwrote newer task/workspace results.
- GREEN: 50 tests across coordinator, shell/commit/diff hooks, shell reducers,
  and git-status handlers passed. Coverage includes scope retirement, 32-key
  inactive eviction, shared retries, terminal snapshots, and invalidation drain.
- Replaced selector mocks in the existing commit/diff suites with real-store
  tests. The teardown test now actually clears the snapshot; invalidation races
  assert a serialized follow-up and reject the obsolete result.
- Targeted ESLint, frontend typecheck, and whitespace checks passed.
- Added `use-session-read.ts` and `session-read-test-helpers.tsx` to share the
  scoped subscription and real-provider fixtures without duplicating adapters.

- The full frontend run exposed the Changes badge test's selector-only store
  mock missing `useAppStoreApi`. Its seven counting/isolation cases now use the
  real store through the shared fixture and pass without weakening assertions.

- Final ownership audit added two failing environment-rebinding cases: a late
  commit snapshot overwrote the replacement environment, and an old diff was
  retained after the session moved. Session reads now validate the current
  session-to-environment mapping before publication. All 51 affected coordinator,
  hook, Changes badge, and git-status handler tests pass with this guard.

### PR review follow-up

- Reproduced two shell-list error cases leaving `isLoaded` false and a shared-
  environment diff case dropping one session's response. Failed shell reads
  now settle with known shells (or empty); cumulative-diff ownership uses the
  complete request key while shared shell/commit slices retain environment
  ownership. Late error responses cannot settle a replacement workspace.
- Added passing coverage for invalidation during the coalesced follow-up and
  an unbound consumer ignoring a retired response. The suggested retired-
  snapshot loading defect does not reproduce through the public hook.
- `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=2 pnpm exec vitest run` against the shell, commit, diff,
  Changes-count, coordinator, tree-state, shell-reducer, and git-status-handler
  suites: 8 files / 68 tests passed after the four behavioral RED assertions.
  Frontend TypeScript also passes.
- The private retired-binding snapshot did retain `loading: true`; a new
  33-key detached-read case reproduced that path. Completion now settles its
  private snapshot and trims inactive entries even after the binding expires,
  while the ownership guard still prevents stale store publication.

### Return-navigation review follow-up

- Reproduced obsolete commit and diff publication after environment A-to-B-to-A
  rebinding, both with separate renders and batched store updates (four RED
  assertions). The store subscription now retires invalid bindings immediately,
  and a retired read is permanently unwritable. Returning creates a new entry
  and request even if the original response is still pending.
- Verification: all 78 tests in the eight affected session/tree suites pass,
  together with changed-file ESLint and frontend TypeScript. Commands and final
  delivery results are tracked in Task 04.

### Terminal creation CI follow-up

- The mobile terminal-close E2E exposed newly created shells missing from the
  shared domain store. Removing one terminal rebuilt the local list from an
  empty store and hid its sibling. Deduplicated reads no longer masked the
  missing mutation publication with another mount-time list request.
- Two real-store RED cases cover ordinary and script creation followed by a
  held destroy request. Both creation paths now publish returned shell metadata
  immediately; the surviving sibling stays usable without another list read.
- All 29 tests in six terminal/shell suites, frontend TypeScript, and changed-file
  ESLint pass. Task 04 records the desktop and phone browser verification.
