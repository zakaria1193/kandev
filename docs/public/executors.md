# Executors

An executor determines where Kandev creates a task environment and runs `agentctl`, the selected agent, terminals, and Git commands. An executor profile supplies reusable settings for that executor. A task environment is the concrete workspace created for one task; several sessions may reuse it.

## Quick path

1. Choose **Worktree** for normal isolated Git work.
2. Choose **Local** only when sharing the selected checkout is intentional.
3. Choose Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, or Sprites when the host boundary or remote location is part of the requirement.
4. Review credentials, scripts, mounts, and network policy as part of the executor trust boundary.

## Stable remote helpers

Stable standard installs include a manifest for remote helpers. They do not include the helper
executables. On the first remote task for a platform, Kandev downloads that Stable release's helper
when no verified copy is cached. It checks the helper digest from the installed manifest before use.

The Kandev host needs outbound HTTPS to `github.com` and `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`.
GitHub redirects release-asset downloads to the second host. If network access is not available,
install a full CLI archive or set an existing helper-path override. A full Stable Desktop installer
or updater is not available. Containers and npm Nightlies include all remote helpers.

`mock_remote` also exists in backend models for tests. It is not a product executor.

Only administrators can create, edit, or test a Remote Docker executor, and only administrators can build its image. A saved profile grants effective root on the remote host, and a build runs Dockerfile instructions with that daemon's authority.

Remote Docker reaches its daemon over SSH, not over a daemon URL. The profile stores an SSH target, and Kandev rejects any value carrying a scheme, so `tcp://` is excluded by construction. An unsecured daemon port is remote root; `ssh://` needs no extra setup because Docker's SSH transport runs `docker system dial-stdio` over the connection you already have. The older stored fields `docker_host`, `docker_tls_verify`, and `docker_cert_path` are not used by this runtime.

Remote Docker writes nothing to the remote host's filesystem. The `agentctl` helper, the agent's session directory, and the credential and configuration files seeded into it are all delivered into the container through the Docker Engine API, so they live in Docker-managed storage and are removed when the container is. Nothing accumulates in the SSH user's home directory, and archiving or deleting a task removes that agent's credentials with its container.

That makes the remote host's requirements narrow: an SSH account that can run commands (`docker system dial-stdio` and a platform probe) and open TCP forwards, plus access to the Docker socket. Remote Docker needs no SFTP subsystem and no writable home directory, so a minimal or immutable host where Docker is the only management surface is supported. This is the one place Remote Docker is less demanding than SSH, which does require SFTP and a writable workdir root.

If you ran Remote Docker before this change, the remote account may still hold a `~/.kandev` tree from those launches. Kandev removes a task's own `~/.kandev/agent-sessions/<instance-id>/` directory when you archive or delete it. The cached `~/.kandev/bin/agentctl` helper is shared with the SSH executor and is left alone; remove it by hand if no SSH profile targets that host.

The connection test's **Docker daemon** step reports which of three different problems it hit, because each needs a different fix on the remote host. The SSH user cannot use the Docker socket: add that user to the `docker` group there, then test again over a new connection, since group membership applies from the next login. The host has no `docker` command: install the Docker CLI, which the SSH transport needs in addition to the daemon. The CLI ran but no daemon answered: start Docker on that host. Each failure shows the remote's own error alongside the fix.

Choose Remote Docker over a single-node Kubernetes cluster when you want a container per task on one machine and do not otherwise run Kubernetes. Kubernetes covers the same ground and adds resource limits, admission control, and scheduling, but it asks for a storage provisioner, a namespace, RBAC, and a worker image built and pushed to a registry by digest. Remote Docker keeps the Docker executor's Dockerfile-and-build loop, with no registry in the basic case.

## Plugin-managed remote executors

Plugin remote providers appear in **Settings > Executors** when an installed, active plugin declares a compatible `executor_providers` contract. No separate feature flag or restart is required. Disabled, incompatible, or unavailable providers remain ineligible for new launches, and built-in executors continue to work when no provider plugin is installed.

The plugin provisions and removes provider compute. Kandev owns agentctl, agent lifecycle, workspace materialization, task authorization, and durable resource inventory. A provider must support recovery with the original operation identity. Kandev keeps unresolved cleanup inventory when a provider is unavailable or removal is not confirmed.

Review each provider's retention and expiry before launch. `persistent` means the provider reports no fixed expiry. `bounded` includes a maximum lifetime. `ephemeral` means workspace data ends with the compute environment. `unknown` makes no retention promise. The task environment disclosure reports effective retention, known expiry, current status, and available cleanup actions.

Remote environments need outbound access to the configured Kandev API URL. Providers return short-lived HTTPS connection leases for agentctl. Do not place provider credentials in endpoint URLs, task metadata, or resource state. See [Authoring plugins](plugins-authoring.md#remote-executor-providers) and the [plugin manifest reference](plugins-manifest.md#remote-executor-providers).

## Embedded VS Code availability

**VS Code (Embedded)** starts code-server inside the active task environment, so its availability
follows that session's executor rather than the operating system of the browser or desktop app.
It is available for Local and Worktree sessions on Linux or macOS, and for Linux-backed Local
Docker, Kubernetes, Sprites, and supported SSH sessions. Native Windows Local and Worktree sessions do not
offer it. See [Developer tools](developer-tools.md#files-and-editor-integrations) for code-server network and
download requirements.

## Create and select a profile

Open **Settings > Executors**, then choose **Local**, **Worktree**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Sprites.dev**, **Remote Docker**, or **SSH** under **Create New Profile**. Local and Worktree profiles already exist in a new database.

Open a saved profile from the Executors hub, the Settings tree, an executor profile list, Settings search, or a task's executor disclosure to use the same complete profile editor.

  title="Choose an agent and executor profile"
  caption="Agent, model, repository, and executor choices are reviewed before starting a task."
/>

A profile stores:

- its name;
- environment variables, either as a literal value or a Kandev secret reference;
- a prepare script and cleanup script;
- an MCP policy JSON object;
- runtime-specific configuration.

Literal environment values are stored with the profile. Use secret references for credentials. Resolved values and copied credential files normally become accessible to the agent and commands in that environment, including repository setup scripts and the terminal panel's shells. A terminal that is already open keeps the environment it started with; open a new terminal after changing the profile. SSH is narrower: its remote agent process and terminals receive only the credential allowlist documented below, not arbitrary profile variables.

The MCP editor checks only that the value is a JSON object. Its presets cover stdio, HTTP, and SSE transport allowances, server allowlists, and URL rewrites. Test restrictive policies with the actual MCP servers the agent needs; see [Automation and MCP](automation-and-mcp.md).

Profile edits apply when Kandev provisions a launch, but a Docker container or Sprite resume can reconnect to the already provisioned process, image, environment, credentials, and files. Kubernetes records a separate workload snapshot for each session; changing its profile affects new sessions, while an existing session and any replacement Pod keep that snapshot. Use **Reset Environment** or explicitly destroy the resource when a change must take effect on a fresh environment. Deleting or editing a profile does not tear down an already-running resource.

### Repository environment secrets

Open a workspace repository's editor to add **Environment secrets** bindings. Each binding maps a POSIX environment key to a Global secret or a Workspace secret from that same workspace. A task receives the bindings from every repository attached to it, along with its selected executor profile environment. The resolved snapshot is available to repository setup scripts, the agent, child shells, and new terminal-panel terminals on supported executors.

Kandev fails closed before provisioning when a repository binding is missing, deleted, unreadable, unauthorized, or from another workspace. It also rejects ambiguous keys: identical references to the same secret are merged, while different secret IDs, literal-versus-secret bindings, or different literal values for one key are a launch error. The error identifies the key and source origins without exposing secret values or IDs. Editing a binding or rotating a secret does not mutate a running process or an open terminal. Fresh provisioning, a cold recreation, or **Reset Environment** resolves the current bindings; warm resume keeps its existing snapshot.

SSH has an additional forwarding boundary. Remote agent and terminal instances receive the managed credential allowlist plus the repository keys explicitly approved by these bindings. Arbitrary host, request, or unrelated executor-profile variables are not forwarded to the remote process.

### Portable agent configuration

Local Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, and Sprites profiles can copy selected agent configuration
bundles. Open an agent row in the remote credentials settings to choose that
agent's authentication files and configuration bundles independently.
Kandev owns the allowlist. You cannot enter an arbitrary host path or copy a
complete agent home.

Kandev copies each selected file without changes. A file can contain secrets,
environment values, hooks, commands, model settings, permissions, MCP servers,
endpoints, or host paths that do not work in the executor. A fresh provision or
**Reset Environment** can replace the target file. A warm resume keeps the
existing executor file and does not read the host again.

Each file is limited to 1 MiB and each launch is limited to 4 MiB. Kandev
writes copied files with owner-only mode `0600`. Missing, unreadable, invalid,
or oversized optional files produce a preparation warning and do not stop the
launch. File contents are not returned by the API or stored in the profile.

SSH writes below the configured remote user's home. If that account is shared,
the copied configuration can affect other processes that use the same account.
Review the selected bundles before saving the profile.

### Model selection in remote executors

The host model probe helps edit a profile, but it is not the launch authority.
At launch, the selected executor's advertised ACP catalog decides whether
Kandev sends the saved model. Profiles are compatible by default. When the
saved model is absent, Kandev can use an advertised explicit fallback, one
unique bracketed variation, or the executor's current or default model. An
automatic-fallback profile continues with the provider default and ignores its
saved explicit fallback. Kandev writes one warning to task chat when it uses a
different model.

Enable **Require exact model** on a profile when a substitution is not allowed.
The executor must advertise and accept the saved model before the first prompt.
An unavailable model, empty or unsupported catalog, or failed apply stops the
session before inference. The session error reports the requested model, the
effective model when known, and a stable reason. Kandev does not send an
unadvertised model or rewrite the saved profile model.

A missing host-probe model remains an advisory warning and does not disable
profile selection. Portable configuration can improve parity, but it does not
guarantee equal host and executor model catalogs.

### Cursor Cloud

Cursor Cloud runs an interactive task on Cursor-hosted compute. It does not
create a Kandev workspace or expose terminal, file editing, LSP, preview, or
local Git controls. Enable the `features.cursorCloud` toggle and restart
Kandev before configuring or selecting this executor. The shipped prod, dev,
and e2e profiles keep it disabled.

Create a **Cursor Cloud** executor profile from **Settings > Executors**. Store
the Cursor Cloud API key in a Kandev Global secret and select that secret in
the profile. The key uses the Cursor account's billing and attribution. Anyone
authorized to use this profile can submit paid work to that account, so limit
profile access and rotate the key through the secret store.

Set **Managed MCP callback URL** to the HTTPS origin of this Kandev installation
or to `https://your-domain.example/api/v1/managed-agent-mcp`. The callback must
be reachable by Cursor Cloud over HTTPS. A reverse proxy must forward this
route to Kandev and preserve its authorization header. A proxy that requires
interactive browser sign-in cannot serve as the callback. The profile's
**Test connection** action checks the key, Cursor API access, and callback URL
syntax. It does not prove that Cursor Cloud can reach the callback. The live
smoke test below is required before enabling the feature for an installation.

Use a compatible Cursor Cloud agent profile and choose one GitHub repository
with a published starting branch or commit. The task dialog discloses that
Cursor receives the published repository content; local workspace edits stay
in Kandev and are not uploaded. Cursor creates its own result branch. Kandev
does not fetch, merge, or push that branch into a local workspace. Automatic
pull-request creation is a separate task option and is off by default.

Kandev keeps the cloud conversation attached to the task session. Follow-up
prompts use that conversation. If a request may have reached Cursor but its
result cannot be identified, Kandev blocks further prompts and asks you to
resolve the submission. Bind a matching remote run when one exists. Retry only
after acknowledging that Cursor may perform the same work twice. Stop remains
pending until Cursor confirms cancellation.

Kandev stores the activity it has already received and recovers remote run
status after a disconnect or backend restart. Provider stream history can
expire; Kandev then shows a history-gap notice and retrieves the available
terminal result. Cursor Cloud keeps its own agent independently of a Kandev
task archive or deletion. Archive stops known active work when possible but
does not remove the remote Cursor agent; remove provider-side resources through
Cursor when needed.

#### Live rollout check

Automated tests use a local mock and never submit paid Cursor work. Before
enabling the feature on an installation, use a disposable repository and a
dedicated key. Enable the toggle for that installation and restart Kandev.
Test the API key, published ref, model, and a callback from an actual cloud
run. Exercise a Kandev user question and answer, a streamed tool call, a
follow-up, Stop, and a backend restart during a run. Confirm that the same
remote conversation resumes without a duplicate prompt, results stay out of
the local workspace, and the optional pull request follows the user's choice.
Disable the toggle and confirm that existing history remains readable and new
work is rejected. Record redacted outcomes, remove the disposable Cursor
resources, and keep shipped defaults disabled until this check succeeds.

### Script behavior is runtime-specific

Do not treat the two script fields as universal hooks:

| Runtime          | Prepare script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Profile cleanup script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Failure is logged but does not prevent controller teardown. Plain Stop and backend restart preserve the task workspace and skip cleanup.                                     |

Keep working prepare scripts noninteractive and idempotent. Kandev resolves supported placeholders and appends its managed branch checkout for Docker, Kubernetes, Sprites, and SSH after the user script. A profile cleanup script must never remove paths outside the environment it owns.

The common preparation limit is configured through
`KANDEV_TASK_PREPARATION_TIMEOUT`; see [Configuration](configuration.md#setup-and-launch-timing)
for duration syntax, fallback behavior, and the derived launch-phase limit.

Two current preparation exceptions are easy to miss:

- A repository-free Local task bypasses the environment-preparer stage, even when it uses an explicit workspace folder. Its profile prepare script therefore does not run.
- A Worktree task with two or more attached repositories runs each repository's setup script while creating that repository's worktree, but the current multi-repository preparer does not run the executor profile's task-level prepare script.

## Managed GitHub credentials

workspace credentials** is the default and provides the broker behavior below. Select **Inherit
executor Git credentials** in the workspace GitHub settings to leave Git and `gh` to the host or
selected executor; Kandev then injects no GitHub broker helper or shim. Local and Worktree use
host-visible Git/SSH credentials, while Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, and cloud require executor-configured
credentials. An explicit executor-profile `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` overrides the managed
workspace route.

For attached GitHub repositories, Kandev normally gives the task an opaque lease for each
repository instead of placing the workspace PAT, selected CLI token, or App installation token in
its ambient environment. Git's credential helper selects the lease whose HTTPS host and path
exactly match the repository. A broker-aware `gh` shim redeems the primary repository lease for
each invocation, sets `GH_TOKEN` only on the child `gh` process, and isolates CLI configuration
from the host.

For Local and Worktree tasks, managed credentials cover Kandev's checkout operations and the
launched task processes. Per-repository setup scripts still receive executor-profile and repository
environment bindings, user-configured Git settings, and Kandev's managed build cache, but Kandev
removes broker leases and generated Git and `gh` helper routing before those scripts start. If a
repository setup script needs authenticated GitHub access, configure an explicit scoped profile or
repository credential, or select **Inherit executor Git credentials** and configure the host.

When the workspace uses a GitHub App, the redeemed installation token is minted for that one
repository. On a multi-repository task, Git can redeem each repository's lease, but App-backed
`gh` commands are primary-repository scoped. Run cross-repository GitHub API work through Kandev's
workspace-aware backend surfaces.

PAT and named-CLI automation tokens cannot be cryptographically reduced after redemption. Exact
lease matching prevents accidental cross-repository redemption, but the trusted agent subprocess
receives a bearer token with all scopes and repositories granted by GitHub. An explicit profile
`GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` bypasses managed broker selection entirely and is the operator's
unmanaged grant. Personal GitHub tokens and App registration private keys never enter executors.

For Kubernetes tasks using managed Git access, both preparation and the agent's
commands use the session's current repository leases. Stop/Resume on a retained
Pod refreshes that access for the resumed agent. Changing task access or replacing
the GitHub connection takes effect on the next launch or resume; old managed
leases and generated helpers are not inherited by that new process. Git tokens
do not need to be added to the worker image or executor profile.

Managed Docker, Kubernetes, Sprites, and SSH launches probe the exact credential-resolution route from inside
the executor before clone or agent startup and require its `204 No Content` readiness response.
Network failures, redirects, proxy routing errors, and broker server errors stop launch instead of
falling back to another GitHub credential.

A newly opened task terminal and a CLI-passthrough agent tab use the same task-scoped Git and
GitHub CLI routing as the agent that owns the execution. This applies only after the task
ownership check and does not change **Inherit executor Git credentials** mode. A terminal that is
already open keeps the environment from its launch; reopen it after a new session launch, resume,
or a Git credential-policy change.

### Workspace automation identity and task Git transport

The workspace GitHub connection is the automation identity Kandev uses for provider operations,
such as finding or creating a pull request. The task Git credential policy is separate: it decides
whether Git uses Kandev-managed credentials or the selected executor's own Git and SSH setup.
Changing the workspace connection does not install an SSH key in an executor.

For **Inherit executor Git credentials**, configure the executor where Git runs. Local and Worktree
use the Kandev host's Git configuration, SSH agent, known-hosts file, and credential helpers.
Docker uses the credentials in the container, while SSH and Sprites use the credentials configured
on the remote environment. A host `gh` login or `~/.ssh` file is not automatically available in a
Docker, SSH, or Sprite executor.

To make host GitHub CLI operations prefer SSH, run this on the Kandev host:

```bash
gh config set git_protocol ssh --host github.com
```

Restart Kandev after changing the host GitHub protocol. The restart lets Kandev reconcile managed
repository origins before the next task launch. For an SSH or Docker executor, configure the
equivalent GitHub SSH access, known-hosts entry, and agent or key on that executor instead.

## Worktree

Worktree creates a dedicated host Git worktree and runs the standalone `agentctl` service against it. It separates branches and files between tasks, but the process still has the Kandev user's host permissions, network access, and readable credentials.

Repository settings control base branch, branch naming, pull-before-create, repository setup/cleanup scripts, and optional copies of ignored files. With **Always pull before creating a new worktree** enabled, a host Worktree refresh is best effort when the selected local base exists. An authentication, network, timeout, missing-ref, divergent-ref, or uncertain-ancestry error produces a credential-safe warning and the host worktree uses the verified local base. The warning states that remote changes may be missing. For a numbered GitHub PR, the current PR base is used when available. A proven deleted remote base can use a separately refreshed configured fallback branch, often the repository default, and produces a warning; authentication, network, timeout, and other unproven PR refresh failures remain fatal. If no usable local base exists, or if the executor must materialize the repository remotely, refresh and checkout remain required and a failure stops the launch. Disable this setting only for an intentional offline local workflow. Copy ignored files narrowly: `.env` and similar files often contain production secrets. Multi-repository tasks receive one materialized worktree per attachment; use the per-repository setup scripts because the profile-level prepare script is currently skipped for that path.

Normal stop keeps the task environment available. Task deletion or **Reset Environment** removes the tracked worktree when configured to clean worktrees. Preserve or push valuable changes first; see [Git Operations](git-operations.md).

Typical failures:

- dirty or conflicting source repository state;
- a base branch is missing locally and remote materialization cannot provide it;
- a remote-only executor cannot verify its refresh or checkout;
- worktree path already registered in Git metadata;
- setup dependencies absent on the host;
- repository cleanup failure leaving a stale worktree.

Use `git worktree list --porcelain` in the source repository when diagnosing stale registrations. Do not delete a worktree directory by hand before checking whether Git still tracks it.

## Local

Local runs directly in the selected checkout. It provides no file isolation: concurrent tasks, the user, and other tools can edit the same files. When sources are attached, Local uses each user-owned repository's current checkout; Kandev does not switch its branch.

Use Local for an intentionally shared checkout, a controlled single task, or a repository-free task with an explicit workspace folder. Prefer Worktree for parallel coding. Stop ends the agent process but does not clean the checkout or undo its changes.

## Workspace sources

An idle, non-archived repository-backed task can add sources from its **Files** panel. Repository sources (saved workspace repository, local Git repository, or remote Git repository) are supported on **Worktree**, **Local/Local PC**, **Local Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **SSH**, and **Sprites**. Worktree materializes Remote Git from Kandev's owned host cache. Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, and Sprites clone local Git sources and therefore require a cloneable origin; Worktree and Local/Local PC can use the host repository directly.

Every repository row records a base branch. Worktree, Docker, SSH, and Sprites may also materialize an existing checkout branch for repository rows. Local/Local PC always uses the repository's current checkout and does not offer or perform a branch switch.

Arbitrary folders are supported only on **Worktree** and **Local/Local PC**. They remain live host paths; Kandev links them into its task workspace and never copies, moves, or deletes their contents. Docker and remote executors do not offer folders and reject a forged folder request. Remote Docker rejects folders for the same reason as the other remote executors: the daemon cannot read the Kandev host's filesystem. It does **not** yet reject a local Git repository source. The host checkout is never sent to the remote daemon, so nothing wrong is mounted, but the task is created and then fails while running its prepare script. Give the repository a reachable origin, or choose a local executor. The same gap applies to SSH, Kubernetes, and Sprites; see [kdlbs/kandev#3778](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/issues/3778).

Source batches are atomic: if validation, cloning, or runtime adoption fails, Kandev removes the new records and Kandev-owned entries while preserving existing task contents. Persisted attachments are reapplied after reload, relaunch, or **Reset Environment**; a previously attached folder that later disappears is reported instead of silently skipped. See [Tasks and workflows](tasks-and-workflows.md#add-sources-to-an-existing-task).

## Local Docker

> **Daemon authority:** Dockerfile instructions run with the configured daemon's authority. Treat profile creation as an administrative operation on that daemon.

<details>
<summary>Local Docker details</summary>

### Prerequisites and profile creation

Install a reachable Docker Engine and leave `docker.enabled: true` (the non-containerized backend default). The published Kandev service image overrides this to `false`; see [Docker](docker.md#using-docker-for-agent-environments). The runtime health method is currently a no-op and the client is initialized lazily, so a green control-plane startup does not prove daemon access; image build or first task launch is the effective check.

Choose **Settings > Executors > Docker**. The current UI requires an image tag, Dockerfile content, and a successful **Build Image** operation before it creates the profile. **Use defaults** supplies:

- image tag `kandev/multi-agent:latest`;
- `node:22-slim`;
- `git`, CA certificates, and `curl`;
- `/workspace` as the working directory.

The build request sends a single Dockerfile-only context to the configured daemon. `COPY` cannot see repository files. Every Dockerfile instruction runs with the daemon's authority, so profile creation is an administrative operation on that daemon.

At launch Kandev:

1. uses the profile's `image_tag`;
2. creates `kandev-agent-<execution-prefix>` with Kandev task/session labels;
3. bind-mounts a released Linux `agentctl` helper read-only at `/usr/local/bin/agentctl`;
4. publishes control and agent ports to random ports on Docker-host loopback;
5. runs the resolved prepare script, which normally clones attached repositories into `/workspace` and checks out the Kandev branch;
6. starts `agentctl` even if prepare failed, then creates the agent instance.

The repository workspace itself is not a normal host bind mount. For a local filesystem clone URL, Kandev temporarily mounts that local clone source read-only so the in-container `git clone` can read it. Images need the selected agent's dependencies; they do not need to contain `agentctl`.

The daemon connection comes from global Kandev configuration. At present, the client uses `docker.host` and optional `docker.apiVersion`. The accepted `docker.tlsVerify` and `docker.volumeBasePath` settings are not applied by the current Docker client/container manager. Per-executor `docker_host` values are also not used by this runtime.

The current container manager always selects the Linux/amd64 `agentctl` helper. Use a Linux/amd64-compatible agent image and daemon (native or correctly emulated); native ARM64 agent containers are not yet wired to the released ARM64 helper.

Kandev passes each agent definition's CPU and memory limits to Docker. These are agent implementation defaults, not executor-profile controls. Apply additional daemon, cgroup, storage, and network policy outside Kandev when required.

</details>

### Container networks

Both Docker profiles have a **Container networks** card. It chooses which Docker networks a task container attaches to. Kandev never creates a network; every name must already exist on the daemon that will host the container.

**Primary network** is the network the container is created on, and the one Docker publishes its ports on. Kandev reaches the agent through a published port, so this must be a network that publishes ports. A `macvlan`, `ipvlan`, or `null` network is refused here, as is a network mode such as `host`, `none`, or a `container:` value. A missing network is refused too, and every rejection names the field and the reason before any container is created.

Leaving it empty uses the daemon's own default network, which is what Kandev did before the network was configurable. There is no global setting: a network name only means something on the daemon that owns it, and a Local Docker profile and a Remote Docker profile do not share one.

**Additional networks** are attached after the container is created and before it starts, so the agent sees every interface for its whole life. Any driver is allowed here, which is where a `macvlan` or `ipvlan` network belongs when a task container needs an address on your physical LAN.

**Gateway priority** selects which attachment provides the container's default route; the highest value wins. Set it when a secondary attachment would otherwise capture the default route and break the return path for the agent connection arriving on the primary network. Leave every priority empty to keep Docker's own choice. The field requires Docker 28 or newer; an older daemon ignores it rather than reporting an error.

### User namespace support

Profiles can enable **User namespace support** under the Dockerfile build card. When enabled, the container is launched with a tailored seccomp profile that relaxes namespace-related syscall restrictions, plus `apparmor=unconfined`. This allows agent runtimes that sandbox file edits via user namespaces (e.g., Codex's `apply_patch` → bwrap) to work inside the container.

The setting is **off by default**, only available on Docker profiles, and affects **newly created containers only**. Existing task environments must be reset for the change to take effect. See the [security ADR](../decisions/2026-08-18-executor-userns-security-options.md) for details on the exact syscall changes and security model.

### Credentials and security

> **Trust boundary:** A container is useful but not a hostile-code sandbox. The daemon has host-level power, bind mounts expose sources, agents can use injected secrets, and the default image has outbound network access. Kandev does not mount the Docker socket automatically. The User namespace support option relaxes container isolation. See the [security ADR](../decisions/2026-08-18-executor-userns-security-options.md).

<details>
<summary>Docker credential and security details</summary>

Docker profiles can inject resolved environment secrets. For agent file-based authentication, Kandev selectively seeds a per-execution directory under `<KANDEV_HOME_DIR>/agent-sessions/` and mounts that directory at the agent's expected config path. It does not intentionally mount the entire host home. Remote Docker seeds the same files, but delivers them into the container through the Docker Engine API instead of mounting a directory, so nothing is written to either the Kandev host or the remote host.

A container is a useful boundary, not a hostile-code security sandbox. The Docker daemon has host-level power, bind mounts expose their sources, the agent can use every injected secret, and the default image has outbound network access. Kandev does **not** mount the Docker socket into agent containers automatically.

Plain Stop preserves a healthy container for resume. A later launch reconnects to an existing running container, or starts one in a stopped/exited state; if reconnect fails, it creates a fresh container. Archive, delete, stale cleanup, explicit removal in the profile page, and **Reset Environment** can stop or force-remove it. Inspect matching containers before manual cleanup:

```bash
docker ps -a --filter label=kandev.managed=true
```

</details>

## Kubernetes

> **Cluster authority:** A Kubernetes profile is an administrator-authored Pod template. It can request powerful workload settings, and every injected task credential is available to the main container. Use admission policy, a dedicated namespace, a narrowly scoped API identity, and a separate workload service account.

Kubernetes maps one task to one namespaced Pod, with an independent agentctl instance for each session, and reaches the injected `agentctl` through a process-local `127.0.0.1` port-forward. The backend can authenticate from an absolute kubeconfig path on the Kandev host or from its own in-cluster service account. It never falls back to a local executor when cluster configuration, admission, exec, or port-forward fails.

The current experimental matrix validates API and `agentctl` connectivity on Kubernetes 1.34.8 and 1.36.1 and runs the full lifecycle suite on 1.36.1. Other server versions have not yet been validated.

Choose **Settings > Executors > Kubernetes**. Only an administrator can create, change, delete, or test a Kubernetes executor or profile. Members can view and select configured profiles, start or resume their own authorized sessions, and read the sanitized session inventory. Administrator change and deletion confirmations use a global impact count without exposing cross-user task or session identities.

Opening a saved Kubernetes profile puts the shared cluster connection editor, connection test, and executor-wide active sessions before workload settings. The test uses current unsaved connection and profile values. Administrators edit both resources through one Save/Reset flow, while members see the same hierarchy read-only. Configured executor rows and task settings icons open the selected profile directly; the standalone connection route remains only for an executor with no profiles.

Kubernetes Pod glyphs on Kanban cards and in task lists hydrate from the exact task/session status when they render, before any hover. While the page is visible, mounted indicators refresh automatically every 90 seconds and retry failed reads. Fine-pointer hover or keyboard focus shows a compact structured Pod summary; touch opens the same summary in a bottom Drawer without activating the task row. Duplicate indicators for the same session share the current read instead of issuing parallel requests.

Each executor fixes one namespace and connection configuration. Each profile supplies one strict `core/v1` `PodTemplate`, a main-container name, `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`, and one workspace mode:

| Workspace mode | Persistence and ownership                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Managed PVC    | Kandev creates one claim for the task, preserves it across ordinary stop, backend restart, and Pod replacement, then deletes it only during task archive/delete cleanup after exact identity checks. |
| `emptyDir`     | Fast Pod-scoped storage. It survives a main-container restart but is lost with the Pod, so a missing Pod cannot be recovered. No PVC permission is required.                                         |
| Existing claim | Kandev verifies and mounts the named claim in the executor namespace. It never creates or deletes that claim. Concurrent-access safety depends on the claim and application.                         |

The starter template uses `ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:latest`, which is a moving tag. Pin a released `ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:X.Y.Z` tag or immutable digest for controlled environments. A custom main-container image must match the selected Linux architecture and provide `sh`, `sleep`, `git`, Node.js, npm, the selected agent CLI or its installation prerequisites, CA trust, and any repository build tools. It must also allow the runtime user to write `/opt/kandev`, `/run/kandev/home`, and `/workspace`; set a compatible user/group or Pod `fsGroup` when the storage driver requires it.

The repository also provides copyable `minimal`, `node-pnpm`, and `python`
worker recipes in [`k8s/worker-images`](../../k8s/worker-images/README.md) plus
strict [`k8s/presets`](../../k8s/presets/) examples. Build and smoke-test a
selected target with the pinned base image, then replace its image marker with
an immutable registry digest. The current Kind evidence covers Linux `amd64`
only. These files are profile inputs, not standalone Pod manifests; Kandev
continues to own bootstrap, credentials, runtime mounts, and the workspace.

Stop, including force-stop, removes only the selected agentctl instance. Other sessions and the task workspace remain available. Agent, main-container, and backend restarts preserve the Pod and workspace. Resume verifies the recorded name, UID, and complete ownership-label identity, creates a new local port-forward, and reconnects. Every managed create also carries a fresh 256-bit request nonce so an ambiguous API response cannot make Kandev adopt or delete a copied-label object. Task archive/delete cleanup deletes only the exact recorded Pod and, for managed storage, the exact Kandev-created PVC. A same-name object with another UID, ownership identity, or create nonce is left untouched and cleanup fails closed.

Saved executor connection settings are different from the recorded workload snapshot. Current kubeconfig/in-cluster credentials, context, and timeout are used to reach an existing session; changing them can restore or break reconnect and cleanup. Existing sessions continue to target their recorded namespace even if the saved namespace changes, and the saved namespace affects new task Pods only. Current Pod template, image, platform, main container, and storage settings also affect new task Pods only; additional sessions reuse the task's recorded workload. If Kandev must replace a missing Pod, it uses the recorded namespace and workload snapshot rather than the edited profile.

An executor cannot be deleted or changed into or out of Kubernetes while runtime inventory still references it. Clear the sessions through normal terminal cleanup first; deleting a profile does not mutate or destroy a retained workload.

The profile's **Active sessions** card also shows retained rows after Stop.
Separate session and Pod states explain whether the recorded session is active,
retained, terminating, terminal, missing, or unknown. Main-container CPU and
memory values are requests from the verified Pod spec, not actual usage or
cost. Stop preserves a resumable Kandev-managed workspace; Archive or Delete
can remove it. Kandev does not delete an operator-owned existing claim.

All sessions in a task share one credential trust boundary. Same-UID agents can read sibling credentials even when their profiles differ. Operators must trust every attached agent and revoke or rotate exposed credentials after compromise. See [Kubernetes](k8s.md#configure-the-kubernetes-executor) for the trust boundary, kubeconfig and in-cluster setup, the opt-in namespaced RBAC manifest, exact ownership labels, diagnostics, template rules, and recovery guidance.

## Sprites.dev

> **Credentials and network:** Sprites sandboxes receive highly sensitive data. Credential upload is best effort, and network policy is installed only after credential upload, prepare, controller startup, and agent-instance creation; bootstrap traffic may happen first, so the policy is not a security boundary.

<details>
<summary>Sprites.dev details</summary>

### Configure

1. Save the provider token as a Kandev secret.
2. Choose **Settings > Executors > Sprites.dev**.
3. Select that secret for the required `SPRITES_API_TOKEN` profile environment variable.
4. Review remote credential methods, Git identity, prepare/cleanup scripts, and network policy.

Sprites profiles do not copy the host-active `gh` CLI token. Kandev may copy explicitly selected agent credential files, resolve selected Kandev secrets into agent environment variables, or run an agent auth setup script. A profile-selected GitHub token is an unmanaged override; otherwise an attached GitHub repository uses the workspace credential broker. Set `githubCredentialBroker.publicBaseUrl` (or `KANDEV_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_BROKER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) to an HTTPS Kandev URL reachable from remote executors. To recover managed Git credentials after a backend restart, configure the stable secret `githubCredentialBroker.reissueSigningKey` (or `KANDEV_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_BROKER_REISSUE_SIGNING_KEY`); changing it invalidates outstanding execution capabilities. Drain or quiesce active agent sessions before key rotation. The broker uses `/api/v1/git/credentials/resolve` and `/api/v1/git/credentials/reissue`; the older GitHub paths remain compatibility aliases. These settings are independent of GitHub App registration. Credential upload is best-effort: provisioning can continue while later agent authentication fails. The remote sandbox receives highly sensitive data; use a scoped provider token and least-privilege repository credentials.

Network rules are stored in `sprites_network_policy_rules` as JSON entries with `domain`, `action` (`allow` or `deny`), and optional `include`. Kandev applies them only on fresh sandbox creation, and currently does so after credential upload, prepare, controller startup, and agent-instance creation. Bootstrap traffic can therefore occur before the profile policy is installed. A parse/provider failure is reported as skipped and does not abort launch. Provider semantics remain authoritative; do not treat this late, best-effort step as a security boundary, and test the resulting policy.

Fresh launch creates a sandbox named `kandev-<execution-prefix>`, uploads the Linux/amd64 `agentctl`, uploads credentials, runs prepare, starts the controller, and opens a local proxy to its control port. The current Sprites path does not probe sandbox architecture; it assumes x86-64. A failed fresh launch destroys the new sandbox. Resume reconnects to the recorded sandbox; if it no longer exists or has expired, Kandev warns and provisions a fresh one on the recorded branch.

Plain Stop preserves the sandbox and workspace for resume. Archive/delete terminal stops attempt to destroy it, and the profile page can list and explicitly destroy Kandev-named sandboxes with the selected provider token. **Reset Environment** also requests sandbox destruction, but the current direct-reset path does not carry the profile's Sprites secret into that destroy request; after a reset or backend restart, verify the old sandbox in the profile page and destroy it there if it remains. Provider retention, quotas, network behavior, and billing remain provider-dependent. Destroying a sandbox out of band breaks any session that still references it.

</details>

## SSH

> **Trust boundary:** Verify the target host fingerprint before saving. Kandev pins the target key, but unknown ProxyJump bastion keys may be accepted on first use; remote credential transfers write sensitive material under the remote user's home.

<details>
<summary>SSH details</summary>

SSH is implemented as a separate remote connection per session. Kandev uploads a platform-matched `agentctl` helper over SFTP, starts it in the remote task directory, and forwards its port to local loopback.

### Host requirements

- Linux `amd64`/`arm64` or macOS `amd64`/`arm64`;
- SSH public-key authentication and SFTP;
- `bash` on Linux or `zsh` on macOS by default, or a compatible configured login shell;
- TCP forwarding enabled by `sshd` and enough `MaxSessions` capacity;
- the selected agent command already installed and visible to a login shell;
- writable remote home and adequate disk/process capacity.

Released Kandev bundles include helpers for all four platform combinations. The full automated SSH task E2E target currently exercises a Linux/amd64 container; other platform gates and helper selection are unit-tested.

### Create the connection

Choose **Settings > Executors > SSH**. Enter a name plus either a Host or a host alias from your OpenSSH client configuration. The backend resolver can inherit `HostName`, `Port`, `User`, `IdentityAgent`, `IdentityFile`, and one `ProxyJump`; explicit form values win. The current create form defaults and persists Port `22` and identity source `ssh-agent`, so enter a non-22 alias port and desired identity source explicitly instead of assuming those two values inherit. `IdentitiesOnly` and arbitrary OpenSSH directives are not consumed by Kandev.

Authentication choices are:

- ssh-agent, using the host's expanded `IdentityAgent` when configured and otherwise `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`; or
- an unencrypted private-key file.

`IdentityAgent none` disables agent authentication for that host. Kandev expands `~`, `${VAR}`, whole-value `$VAR`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, and the `%%`, `%d`, `%h`, `%i`, `%j`, `%k`, `%L`, `%l`, `%n`, `%p`, `%r`, and `%u` OpenSSH tokens in agent socket paths; `%C` is not supported. Password and keyboard-interactive authentication are not supported. A passphrase-protected key file must first be loaded with `ssh-add`, then used through ssh-agent.

Run **Test Connection**, independently verify the observed SHA256 host fingerprint, select **Trust this host**, then save. Kandev pins the final target fingerprint and refuses a changed key. With ProxyJump, the target remains pinned, but bastion handling is weaker: Kandev checks `~/.ssh/known_hosts` when available and rejects a changed known key, while an unknown bastion key is accepted on first use. Verify and pre-populate the bastion key yourself.

The profile editor exposes remote shell and agent-readiness checks. Backend/API configuration also recognizes `ssh_workdir_root` (default `~/.kandev`) and `ssh_shell`; the current profile UI exposes `ssh_shell` but not a workdir-root field.

The remote-auth card is built from the currently enabled agents. Depending on an agent's declared methods, it can copy selected local credential files, resolve a stored secret into that agent's authentication environment variable, or run an agent-specific setup script on the remote host. GitHub can use an explicitly selected `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret as an unmanaged profile override; Kandev does not copy the host-active `gh` token.

OpenCode credential copies merge top-level provider entries with the existing remote `auth.json`. Remote-only providers remain, and the selected host entry replaces the same provider on the remote. If either file is unreadable or is not a JSON object, Kandev leaves the remote file unchanged and reports the credential-copy error.

These transfers write sensitive material under the remote user's home and are best-effort. Verify authentication on the remote after saving. Although the profile editor also stores Git name/email controls for SSH, the current SSH runtime does not apply them; configure Git identity on the remote host yourself.

</details>

### Repository sources and cleanup

> **Cleanup:** SSH task directories, session-runtime data, and cached helpers may remain after disconnect. Audit remote processes and paths before deleting anything.

<details>
<summary>SSH repository source details</summary>

SSH materializes the primary attached repository at the remote task-workspace root and additional repository sources in direct child directories. The default prepare script initializes or reuses the root checkout, verifies the configured origin, fetches the base branch, runs repository setup, and lets Kandev's managed postlude select the task branch. A stored profile script replaces that default and must leave the same verified primary checkout before `agentctl` starts. Existing matching checkouts retain local commits and untracked files; a different origin, missing checkout, failed script, timeout, or cancellation fails the launch before a controller is started. Ensure the remote host has the required Git credentials and can reach every selected remote; folders cannot be attached to SSH tasks.

The runtime preflights the selected agent command and reports an installation hint when missing; it does not install the agent or its toolchain. Only these resolved credential environment names are forwarded to the remote agent: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `GH_TOKEN`. Arbitrary profile variables and control-plane process variables are not forwarded to that agent process. Agent-specific auth setup scripts can still consume a selected stored secret and materialize their own remote login state.

Stop attempts to kill the session's remote `agentctl` and remove only the remote session-runtime directory, then closes forwarding and SSH. Terminal archive/delete stops run the profile cleanup script first; cleanup is best-effort, so a failure does not block controller teardown. Plain Stop and backend restart skip cleanup and preserve the task workspace for resume. The task directory always remains and no background sweeper currently removes it. The cached helper and checksum at `~/.kandev/bin/agentctl` and `agentctl.sha256` also remain for later sessions. Periodically audit the remote process list, session directories, and `<workdir-root>/tasks/` after confirming no session needs the data. Resume re-dials SSH and reuses a live recorded PID when possible; otherwise Kandev starts a fresh remote controller and re-runs preparation.

</details>

### Reachability

A background poller probes each active SSH executor's configured host on
`executors.sshReachabilityIntervalSeconds` (default 60s; see
[Configuration](configuration.md)) and records whether the TCP dial and SSH
handshake succeeded. The result (reachable, unreachable with a failure
reason, or unknown before the first probe) appears on the executor's
**Settings > Executors > SSH** page, including the probed host, how long ago
the last successful probe was (or that none has ever succeeded), and a manual
**Probe now** action.

If a task launches against a host currently recorded as unreachable, Kandev
publishes a `session.launch.warning` event for the launched session. The task's
chat panel shows an inline warning naming the host and the age of the last
successful probe before the attempt proceeds. The gateway keeps the latest
warning while the backend is running, so a later session subscriber receives
it too. Workflow and dependency launches use the same event path.

The probe deliberately does two things and no more: it reports what it
observed, and it never blocks or delays a launch on that basis. It does not
retry a failed connection immediately, and it does not move, reconfigure, or
otherwise repair a host that has become unreachable or changed address;
fixing the host or the connection settings remains an operator action.

## Lifecycle and cleanup

The task environment reports `creating`, `ready`, `stopped`, or `failed`; individual execution records have finer states. Stop is deliberately not synonymous with destroy for resumable Docker, Kubernetes, and Sprites environments.

Use a task's **Reset Environment** action when you need a clean materialization. Kandev blocks reset while a task session is starting or running, can optionally push the current branch, and requests teardown of the recorded worktree, container, Pod/managed PVC, or sandbox. It normally keeps the environment record when teardown returns an error. Kubernetes keeps an existing claim and refuses deletion when recorded UID or ownership identity is ambiguous. The current Sprites credential-context limitation described above can instead report success while leaving the provider sandbox, so verify it separately. SSH task directories are intentionally retained; use the profile cleanup script for terminal hook work and remove the directory manually only after confirming no session needs it.

Before deleting any environment, push or otherwise preserve uncommitted work. Profile deletion and provider/daemon-side deletion can bypass normal lifecycle safeguards.

## Troubleshooting

- **Profile missing at launch:** ensure the executor is active, the profile still exists, and the task/workflow references the correct IDs.
- **Prepare reports failure but agent starts:** expected for Local, Worktree, and Docker; inspect the failed step output and retry commands inside the same environment.
- **Docker unavailable:** verify global `docker.enabled`, effective `docker.host`, daemon permission, image existence, and the released Linux helper path.
- **Docker clone fails:** test the clone URL, base branch, DNS, CA trust, and token scope from inside the selected image.
- **Kubernetes test fails at streaming:** check `pods/exec` and `pods/portforward` `get/create`, API proxy WebSocket/SPDY upgrades, probe-Pod scheduling, and image support for `sh`/`sleep`.
- **Kubernetes session cannot resume or clean up:** restore cluster credentials and context that can reach the recorded namespace, then compare the recorded Pod/PVC UID and complete ownership labels. Do not delete a same-name object.
- **Kubernetes workspace fails:** inspect StorageClass, quota, claim binding/access mode, volume permissions, runtime user, and Pod `fsGroup`; an `emptyDir` workspace cannot survive a missing Pod.
- **Sprite cannot resume:** check provider token, quota, sandbox existence, expiration, and network policy; a missing sandbox triggers fresh provisioning.
- **SSH handshake fails:** test ssh-agent/key access, host fingerprint, bastion trust, SFTP, TCP forwarding, and remote OS/architecture.
- **SSH agent is missing:** run the reported `command -v` check through the configured login shell and install the agent on that host.
- **Disk usage grows:** inspect **Settings > System > Disk usage**, Docker containers, provider sandboxes, host worktrees, and retained SSH task directories before removal.
